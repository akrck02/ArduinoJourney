# ArduinoJourney

Hey there! I'm trying to learn some electronics / hardware basics to improve my skills as a developer so I decided to share with you this little journey.

Sometimes I think that software developers that work on abstract concepts ignore the physical side of the computer science, so they do code, but without the whole 'big scheme of layers' that creates the modern digital world. üíª

That's why I decided to start challenging myself trying to learn hardware and electronics even better.

## Hardware I am using

To develop the code that is stored repository I use the following hardware:

> üíª  &nbsp; **|** &nbsp; MSI Modern 14 / i7 10510U / 16GB RAM DDR4 2666Mhz
>
> üñ•Ô∏è  &nbsp; **|** &nbsp; ryzen 7 - 3700x / Radeon Rx6700 10GB / 32GB RAM DDR4 3200Mhz 
>
> ‚öôÔ∏è  &nbsp; **|** &nbsp; Elegoo Uno R3 (Arduino uno R3) Super starter kit


## How to reproduce this prototypes?

First of all you'll need the arduino board and accessories for the pack or similar ones, then, you'll need to install the [arduino IDE from the official page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

Then you'll ned to download [the libraries and examples from the Elegoo super starter pack](https://www.elegoo.com/pages/arduino-kits-support-files)

The code to run is available on this repository, but you will need to build the prototype, so I will create a blueprint for each prototype.
